**Varibales**
--------------------------
Variables(labelled containers) are used to store and manage informations(data) within a program. 

`age = 25`

***Naming Convensions***
- **Declarative Names**: varibale name must be declarative eg: age, name
- **Use Underscore**: multiwords variable names can be sepearted by using underscore eg: cart_items, full_name 
- **Avoid Using Reserved Keywords**: Python has reserved keywords with special function such as (print, for if). Avoid these workds as varibale names.  
- **Use lower case letters**: variables names are generally in lowercase. Upper case is used for constants.
```
user_name = "Alice"
total_items_in_cart = 4
```
***input() function***

input function is used to get inputs from the user and hence make the program interactive.
